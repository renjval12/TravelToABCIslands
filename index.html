                <h2>The History</h2>

                <p>The ABC Islands were originally inhabited by the <strong>Caiquetio Native People</strong>. Due to the size and stature of the Caiquetio natives, in 1499 when Spanish colonizer, <strong>Alonso de Ojeda</strong>, one of Christopher Columbus' captain, landed on Curaçao, he named the islands, <em>Las islas de los Gigantes or Islands of the Giants</em></p>

                <p>The first known European colonization of the island was by <strong>Amerigo Vespucci</strong>. By 1527 the Spanish had formed a government and established Catholicism on the islands. In 1634, the Netherlands fought Spain over control of the islands. The Dutch won, (although Spain won them back before abandoning them due to them being of little value) and the islands were then administered by the Netherlands. Due to the abolition of the barbaric transatlantic slave trade in 1863, during the early 20th century, when the neighboring Venezuela found oil, the islands adjusted, and became the location of major oil refineries.

                <p>From 1815 until 1954 the three islands were known as the <strong>Colony of Curaçao and Dependencies</strong>. In 1954, the ABC Islands became part of the <strong>Netherlands Antilles</strong>, which gave them political autonomy within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1986 Aruba withdrew from the Netherlands Antilles, becoming a separate country within the kingdom. Upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on 10 October 2010, Curaçao gained a similar status to Aruba. Bonaire became a special municipality of the Netherlands proper, although it maintains its status of an overseas territory of the European Union.</p>

                <h2>The Culture</h2>
                <h3>Language</h3>
                <p>Due to the Dutch colonization of the ABC Islands, and the influence of enslaved Africans in the Caribbean, the main languages spoken on the islands today are, Dutch and Papiamento</p>
                <p>Papiamento or Papiamentu is a Portuguese-based creole language spoken in the Dutch Caribbean. It is the most widely spoken language on the Caribbean ABC islands, having official status in Aruba and Curaçao. Papiamento is also a recognised language in the Dutch public bodies of Bonaire, Sint-Eustatius and Saba.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Whether it's the rich history, colorful architecture, or the beautiful people, the ABC Islands are some of the most beautiful islands <strong>in the <em>whole world</em></strong>. Unfortunatly, the world, and most of our borders are shut down so we can all recover from a devasting disease. Until it's safe to do so, I hope you can read through this website and feel like you went there yourself.</p>
